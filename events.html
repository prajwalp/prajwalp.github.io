					A pen, a paper and a few words. That's all it takes for a downpour of emotions on paper. <br>
					Poetry is a country, a form, a languge at its most powerful and pristine form, a tempest that has the vigor to touch the soul with even a single verse.<br><br>
					Poems can make you laugh, cry, prickle, can make your toe nails twinkle, make you want to do something or nothing, they can let you know that you are alone in the unknown world, that your bliss and suffering is at the same time shared and forever all your own.<br>
					Verse, an onspot poetry writing competition and recitation session is an event for everyone who loves and appreciates poetry. Whether you are experienced or you want to write your very first poem, you are most welcome to be a part of this event to express your creativity and thoughts. <br><br>
					Come, learn and let's create poetry together.<br><br>
					<b>Rules:</b><br>
					- The event consists of 3 sessions<br>
					- The first session is short and crisp where everyone will be introduced to poetry writing by our judge. Participants shall get to learn few techniques and ideas.<br>
					- In the second session, the participants shall be given 30 minutes to create their own poem based on a given theme or prompt.<br>
					- The prompt or the theme shall be declared on the spot.<br>
					- The third one is a recitation session where participants shall recite the poems they just wrote.<br>
					- The participants will be evaluated on the basis of their ideas, expression and clarity of thought. <br>
					- After the  third session, the poets who regularly write, will also be given a chance to recite their favorite poem(original) which shall not be evaluated.<br><br>

					Imagine reading a well recommended book on a cosy afternoon. You turn the pages in quiet anticipation of what's about to follow, you wait for the plot twist, but damn! It fails to deliver. You secretly wish you had written the book instead. Maybe with the same characters, you could've done a much better job at it. Maybe you could've introduced more spectacular twists and turns and alleys and pathways and turned the story upside down?<br>
					Coffee, cigarettes and more gives you that exact opportunity. Bring out the storyteller in yourself, bring out your inner literary giant. We provide you the thematic devices, you twist and turn and mould them into your own story, poem, play or whatever is your calling.<br><br>
					Be there at IISER Kolkata, on the 26th of August, with your pen out of its sheath. Because we believe you have a story to tell.<br><br>
					<b>Rules:</b><br>
					1) We provide you (paper and) a list of five keywords.<br>
					2) You have to use atleast three of them as your thematic devices, which would be pivotal in your write-up.<br>
					3) You can use them however you like, as characters, as plot twists, central themes or whatever.<br>
					4) You can write whatever you want to, anywhere between 1-2500 words. You get an hour to write it down.<br>
					5) At the 30 min mark, there would be a surprise element for your story from our side. And by the end of it, you would have known your strength in weaving out plots beyond your expectations.<br><br>

					<i><b>Last Date: 25th August 2018</b></i><br><br><br>
					<i>"Science fiction [is] the only genuine consciousness-expanding drug."</i> - Arthur C. Clarke<br><br>
					For a long time, science fiction has been characterised by shiny metal starships, grotesque little green aliens, camp silliness and cheap thrills. And while there's nothing wrong in that - we all need a bit of silliness in our lives - that's not all there is to science fiction. At its best, science fiction is the fiction of ideas. Most, if not all science fiction is an answer to a "What if..." question. It's the fiction of ideas, it's about imagining other worlds, alternate realities, possible (or impossible) futures. At its best, it inspires a sense of wonder, awe and curiosity about the world like nothing else can.<br>
					Here at Lexis, we strive to reach those lofty heights. Sci-Fi Lite is the science fiction event of Lexis 2018, and we hope it'll not only satisfy your creative muse but also make you explore and challenge some deeply held notions. And we hope that, when you put your thoughts to pen and paper (or keyboard and screen) and send us your entries, they'll make us challenge our deeply held notions as well. Because it is only by imagining other worlds and realities that we can truly cherish and love our own.<br><br>

			<p class='evHead'>How a Budding Creative Writer Blossoms</p>
			<p class="evText" id='talkID'>
				<b> By Prof. Ananda Lal</b><br><br>
				<b>Abstract:</b><br>
				Based on society's misconception that STEM subjects are the most difficult and therefore attract the brightest students, many young writers think that literature is the easiest thing in the world. But just like any discipline, whether maths or music, hard work and skill sets form the keys without which talented writers cannot unlock their creativity. I explore what goes into the making of an author, and what doesn't.<br><br>
				<b>About the Speaker:</b><br>
				Ananda Lal is an Indian academic and theatre critic. He is Professor of English and Coordinator, Rabindranath Tagore Studies Centre (UGC), at Jadavpur University, Calcutta. He also heads Writers Workshop now, translates from Bengali to English, is a theatre critic for The Telegraph (Calcutta) and directs university theatre.<br>
				His books include the "Oxford Companion to Indian Theatre" (2004, the first reference work in any language on that subject), "Rabindranath Tagore: Three Plays" (1987 and 2001, the first full-length study in English of Tagorean drama), "Theatres of India" (2009), "Twist in the Folktale" (2004), "Shakespeare on the Calcutta Stage" (2001) and "Rasa: The Indian Performing Arts" (1995).<br><br>

					"We lose ourselves in books. We find ourselves there too."<br><br>
					Cooped up in a little corner all by oneself,with a book in one hand a cup of hot cocoa in another and life's bliss. For most, reading is synonymous to liberation. It is an escapade allowing us to free ourselves from the shackles of worry and anxiety. We yearn for those moments of solace when we are left alone with our book, indifferent to the world outside. <br>
					So,for the joy of reading we'll have a readers retreat with a miniature library in the LHC - a perfect setting to sit back,relax and embark on one's own glorious journey!<br><br>
					<b>Venue:</b> G01<br>
					<b>Time:</b> Throughout the day<br><br>

					It has indeed been rightly opined that knowledge is power and that sharing knowledge is like power multiplied. It is imperative that as a progressive society we share our ideas,our beliefs,our principles and hence to that end our knowldege and the source of it.<br>
					We, at IISER Kolkata recogonize this and to this effect wil be hosting a book exchange event. For the joy of giving, we encourage all to donate a book of their choice and pick any other from our collection in return. Ultimately,sharing is caring!<br><br>

					Dear Hungry People,<br><br> 
					Now that we have your attention, let's talk about something that's important - food. <br>
					Lexis brings to you the comeback you've been secretly waiting for 'Starbucks for Dummies' - a sandwich/Maggi/coffee/pancake/omelette experience (if there's a better word, please use that) started by students of 17MS.<br>
					(Given that inspire and KVPY haven't hit as of now, it's really cheap and super tasty). You can find us around G05 as long as supplies last (we said 24x7 last time, but that didn't work out too well for us).<br><br>
					Cheers,<br>
					Starbucks for Dummies Team<br><Br>
					P.S.: we have Nutella<br>
					P.P.S.: Vimal Da, the Parantha Place, and the LHC cafeteria will be closed. Will you seriously choose the mess over us?<br><Br>
